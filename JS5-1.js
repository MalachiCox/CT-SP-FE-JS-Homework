HW: 
Reverse the list below in-place using an in-place algorithm.
For extra credit: Reverse the strings at the same time.
words = ['this' , 'is', 'a', 'sentence', '.']
# Output: words = ['.', 'ecnetnes', 'a', 'si', 'sith']

Create a function that counts how many distinct words are in the string below, then outputs a dictionary with the words as the key and the value as the amount of times that word appears in the string.
Should output:
{'a': 5,
'abstract': 1,
'an': 3,
'array': 2, ... etcâ€¦
a_text = 'In computing, a hash table hash map is a data structure which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the desired value can be found'


Write a program to implement a Linear Search Algorithm. Also in a comment, write the Time Complexity of the following algorithm.
